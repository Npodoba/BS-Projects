Summary of Merge Conflict

The merge conflict was caused by concurrent changes to the README.md file. To resolve it, 
I manually edited the conflicting sections to include both the student ID from the Test branch 
and the Git version from the Working branch. After resolving the conflict, the changes were 
staged and committed.
